# TensorFlow Neural Network Lab
**Preprocess notMNIST data and train a neural net on it**

We've prepared a Jupyter notebook that will guide you through the process of creating a single layer neural network in TensorFlow.
## Get Started
Run these commands in the terminal to get started:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook lab_1.ipynb
```

This will bring up a browser window with the Jupyter notebook.  The notebook has 3 problems for you to solve:
 - Problem 1: Normalize the features
 - Problem 2: Use TensorFlow operations to create features, labels, weight, and biases tensors
 - Problem 3: Tune the learning rate, number of steps, and batch size for the best accuracy

This is a self-assessed lab.  Compare your answers to the solutions here.  If you have any difficulty completing the lab, Udacity provides a few services to answer any questions you might have.

## Help
Remember that you can get assistance from your mentor, [the forums](https://carnd-udacity.atlassian.net/wiki/questions), or the [Slack channel](https://carnd-inviter.herokuapp.com/). You can also review the concepts from the previous lessons.
