We've prepared a Jupyter notebook that will guide you through the process of creating a single layer neural network in TensorFlow.

## Setup
### Windows
#### Install Docker
If you don't have Docker already, download and install Docker from [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/windows/).  Read the [Shared Drives](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#/shared-drives) documentation to enable drive sharing.
#### Clone the Repository
Run the command below to clone the Lab Repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/udacity/CarND-TensorFlow-Lab.git
```

After running the command above, follow the “Run the Notebook” instructions to start the lab.
### OS X and Linux
#### Install Anaconda
This lab requires [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) and [Python 3.4](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or higher. If you don't meet all of these requirements, install the appropriate package(s).
#### Run the Anaconda Environment
Run these commands in your terminal to install all requirements:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/udacity/CarND-TensorFlow-Lab.git
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
$ conda install --name CarND-TensorFlow-Lab -c conda-forge tensorflow
```
## Run the Notebook
### Start a Jupyter Server
Make sure to run the server from the same directory that you ran in the *Setup* steps above.
#### Windows (PowerShell)
```
$ docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -v ${pwd}:/notebooks udacity/carnd-tensorflow-lab
```
#### OS X and Linux
```
$ source activate CarND-TensorFlow-Lab
$ jupyter notebook
```
### View The Notebook
You setup your environment in the *Setup* steps and started a Jupyter server in the *Start a Jupyter Server* instructions above.  Open a browser window and go [here](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/CarND-TensorFlow-Lab/lab.ipynb).  This is the notebook you'll be working on.  The notebook has 3 problems for you to solve:
 - Problem 1: Normalize the features
 - Problem 2: Use TensorFlow operations to create features, labels, weight, and biases tensors
 - Problem 3: Tune the learning rate, number of steps, and batch size for the best accuracy

This is a self-assessed lab.  Compare your answers to the solutions [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-TensorFlow-Lab/blob/master/solutions.ipynb).  If you have any difficulty completing the lab, Udacity provides a few services to answer any questions you might have.
## Help
Remember that you can get assistance from your mentor, the [Forums](https://carnd-udacity.atlassian.net/wiki/questions), or the [Slack channel](https://carnd-inviter.herokuapp.com/). You can also review the concepts from the previous lessons.
